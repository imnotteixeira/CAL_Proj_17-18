# CAL_Proj_17-18
Solving CAL's group project (Conception and Analysis of Algorithms)

The project consisted of using **pathfinding algorithms** on **graph** structures and study their complexity and use cases.

We also made some optimizations to the base algorithms such as **Multi-Threaded Dijkstra** in order to find a path between two nodes with another node in between (Point of Interest) faster.
